# Conflict and Communication Plan

## CONFLICT PLAN

* Scenarios to keep in mind:

1. Someone not pulling their weight OR someone dominating:
  * Solutions:
      - Open communication and be up front if you’re struggling or having trouble with something
      - If it feels like someone is not pulling their weight, have a stand up or group discussion to assess the situation and what everyone is working on (and has worked on so far)
      - Commit to fixing the situation moving forward
      - Possible redistribution of working moving forward, etc

2. Two people getting into a real argument/emotions running high (people disagreeing on how to build a feature, etc):
  * Solutions: 
      - Everyone take a break for a few minutes to collect their thoughts
      - Ask others in the group to listen and mediate, and if that’s not possible, go to Lena or the TAs as an outside perspective

3. Helpful mindset in terms of approaching other teammates with constructive criticism and productive solutions for fixing processes moving forward

## COMMUNICATION PLAN

* Primary communication: Remo & Slack
  - Zoom can be backup or for smaller sessions if Remo is crashing
  - Zoom can also be a possibility for pair-programming sessions due to its better screen layout
  - Phone numbers as last resort/backup

* Working hours: 9:00am-6:00pm, Monday-Friday
* Team standup (separate from standup with Lena) around 9am each day
* Mention features you are working on after hours, so there’s less chance of a merge contract

* Standup meetings are a good place for everyone to communicate issues they may be having, topics they would like to address, and generally making sure that everyone is feeling safe creatively and psychologically
Check in with everyone regarding their working plans for the day, can organize pair programming as needed
